    <article>
        <p>Today, I joined <a href="https://thefoundation.com/">The Foundation</a>(or TF for short). For those of you who never heard of it, The Foundation is "an online program for starting a software business from nothingâ€¦ without an idea, coding skills, or funding."</p>
<hr />
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I found TF about a year ago. At that time, I just graduated from college in Iowa and moved to San Francisco to look for a job. The problem is, nobody wanted me. I was not skilled enough to work for a tech starup. I was a decent programmar in college, but I felt like I was a joke in the real world. After 3 months of job hunting, I ran out of money. The housing cost in San Francisco is ridiculus. I was miserable and embarressd.</p>
<p>I always wanted to start my own company since I started programming. I had been following hacker news for more than a year and even went to the startup school in October 2014. But I didn't have money to bootstrap unless I get in to an accelerator like YC, so I knew I would have to get a job first. Going back to Japan was not an option for me. Japan's startup eco system was getting better, but Japan's market size is not big enough for a startup. You eventually have to aim for the global market. So It makes sense to start in the US.</p>
<p>Then I learned that raising money from VC is not the only way to start a tech company. I read books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching-ebook/dp/B003YH9MMI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459560033&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=start+small+stay+small">Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to Launching a Startup</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Day-Startup-Learn-Until-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459560095&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+day+startup">The 7 Day Startup: You Don't Learn Until You Launch</a>. I started following internet marketing guys like Pat Flynn and Ramit Sethi. Then I found TF. Bootstrapping business resonated with me. Since you do not take money from VC, you do not have to scale like crazy. Unless you live in the Valley where a lot of capital is available, bootstrapping seemed a better idea.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On My Own</h3>
<p>So I came back to Japan a year from today to start a company. I did not want to bother with job hunting again, so I did some part-time jobs to support myself. I thought about joining TF, but I simply didn't have $6,000 for the program, so I decided to just do it on my own using the free resources available on the website. They give away so much information for free, so I knew exactly what to do, or so I thought.</p>
<p>Soon after I started idea extraction(IE) with restaurant owners, I got stuck. I just could not find big enough a problem to solve. Another industry that I was interested in is clinic. But I just did not know how to contact a clinic or a doctor. I was too scared of cold-calling. For restaurants, I contacted a manager of a restaurant I used to work at, then I got a handful referrals from him. So contacting a restaurant was not a problem. I knew a couple friends who work at a hospital so I did IE with them. But they are just a nurse at a big hospital and I did not know how to contact a decision maker.</p>
<p>I tried other industries like hair salon, piano school and recruiting agencies, but none of them worked. I didn't know anyone to ask for help. I eventually lost momentum and gave up. I realized how important it is to have a community of like minded people who share the same goal as me.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>So I'm really excited to join TF. This time, I don't want to give up. While I was showering, I thought, "Why don't I write a daily blog to keep track of my progress?". I know many successful people who do this. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a>, <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">Fluent in 3 Months</a>, <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/">StartUp podcat</a> are some great examples. While they are monetizing their "challenge", which I'm not planning to do, they all use modern media in a smart way to let the audience hold them accountable.</p>
<p>TF is a 8 month program. I'm not going to define a clear goal, but hopefully I will build a successful business by then.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What I did today</h3>
<p>I watched half of the videos on Mindset module. I also watched 1/3 of the next module, Idea Extraction. I started thinking about what market to go after, but I haven't done any extensive research yet. </p>
